[Zeitgeist](https://zeitgeist.link) is an iOS and iPadOS app for monitoring
[Vercel](https://vercel.com) deployments. Unlike my other apps, Zeitgeist serves
a very specific audience: web developers who deploy their work to Vercel. I
wanted to build a companion app that was powerful while maintaining simplicity
and feeling lightweight. It's also the only app in my portfolio that extensively
relies on an internet connection, and this presented its own set of design
challenges. In this deep dive, I wanted to share some of the architectural
details behind Zeitgeist’s design.

## Notifications

Zeitgeist was built before Vercel sent their own email notifications about
failed builds, so part of the goal for the app from its conception was to offer
timely information about build status. Notifications were added in v3 of the
app, and are more powerful than they first appear.

The first step in getting notifications set up is registering a device with
Apple's Push Notification Service (APNS). This happens across several steps:

<Breakout padding={false} style={{ marginBottom: "var(--sp-m)" }}>
    <HScroll scrollSnapping={false}>
        <Image
            alt="A diagram illustrating how devices are registered for push notifications in Zeitgeist. The diagram is explained in detail below."
            src="/uploads/portfolio/zeitgeist/Registration.svg"
            width={985}
            height={297}
            invertInDarkMode={true}
        />
    </HScroll>
</Breakout>

1. iOS registers the device with APNS.
2. APNS returns a unique device token that will be reused to send notifications
   later.
3. This token is then sent to Zeitgeist's “Postal Service” (ZPS) server, one of
   a few components used to manage notifications for Zeitgeist. Along with the
   token, the Vercel account IDs for the user's signed in accounts are sent to
   the ZPS server.
4. The ZPS server saves the device token and associated account ID into a
   database.

Once this registration is complete, the app can respond to webhook events sent
by Vercel's server. These events are sent when deployments are created or
complete with failure or success, as well as other events such as project
changes.

<Breakout padding={false} style={{ marginBottom: "var(--sp-m)" }}>
    <HScroll scrollSnapping={false}>
        <Image
            alt="A diagram illustrating how webhooks trigger push notifications for Zeitgeist. The diagram is explained in detail below."
            src="/uploads/portfolio/zeitgeist/Webhooks.svg"
            width={985}
            height={297}
            invertInDarkMode={true}
        />
    </HScroll>
</Breakout>

1. An event on Vercel triggers a webhook, which is sent to the ZPS server. The
   payload includes information such as the event type and user ID.
2. ZPS processes the webhook payload. If the event type is supported, the user's
   ID is used to fetch registered device tokens from the register.
3. The register returns all device tokens matching the given user ID.
4. The notification payload is sent to APNS, containing most of the same
   information provided in the original webhook event, such as information about
   a Git commit that caused a deployment.
5. APNS delivers the notification to the user's device as a **background push
   notification**.

Note that the notification is delivered in the background. This allows the
user's preferences to take precedence in how notifications are finally surfaced
to them. In Zeitgeist, users enable notifications on a per-project and per-event
basis, so that they're not swamped by a torrent of notifications about every
deployment in their account.

            Notifications are enabled on a per-project and per-event basis. In
            this project, notifications will be received for production builds
            that fail and succeed. Since all events are sent to the device as
            silent notifications, the app feels responsive with real-time
            updates.

## Networking

The background push notifications also play a part in one of Zeitgeist's most
important features: real-time updates.

When I set out to build Zeitgeist, I wanted it to feel performant and responsive
on every page. This meant two features had to be included in the networking
layer:

1. Real-time updates
2. “[Stale-while-revalidate](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/)”
   (SWR)-style caching

For real-time updates, background push notifications offer a clear signal to the
app about when views should be updated. Whenever there's a new build status, or
a change to a project, the app should request the latest information from
Vercel's servers.

<MuxVideo
    autoPlay={true}
    playsInline={true}
    id={"SitEE5RdAoIyv2t1WmQgiPbhpsV8szsmrIjAynQ8upo"}
    muted={true}
    loop={true}
    caption={
        <>
            Changes on Vercel—such as new builds, completed deployments, or
            project changes—are instantly reflected in the Zeitgeist app thanks
            to its background notifications.
        </>
    }

To make this kind of event propogation simple, I created a SwiftUI View modifier
that makes a view respond to these events, and runs some asynchronous code
(typically fetching new data). I also wanted this asynchronous code to run on
other events, such as:

1. When the view first appears
2. When the user manually refreshes the page
3. When the app receives a webhook from Vercel
4. When the user's session changes
5. When the app reenters the foreground from the background

Here's a simplified snippet of the `dataTask` View modifier:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct DataTaskModifier: ViewModifier {
   @EnvironmentObject var session: VercelSession
   @Environment(\.scenePhase) var scenePhase
   let action: () async -> Void

   func body(content: Content) -> some View {
   content
      // Run the async action when the view appears...
      .task { await action() }
      // ...when the user refreshes
      .refreshable { await action() }
      // ...when background notifications are received
      .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .ZPSNotification)) { _ in
         Task { await action() }
      }
      // ...when the user session changes
      .onReceive(session.objectWillChange) { _ in
         if session.isAuthenticated {
            Task { await action() }
         }
      }
      // ...when the app reenters the foreground
      .onChange(of: scenePhase) { currentScenePhase in
         if case .active = currentScenePhase {
            Task { await action() }
         }
      }
   }
}

extension View {
   // Usage:
   // View.dataTask { await someAsyncFunction() }
   func dataTask(perform action: @escaping () async -> Void) -> some View {
      modifier(DataTaskModifier(action: action))
   }
}
```

To manage SWR-style caching, Swift’s Foundation framework provides
[`URLCache`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcache),
which is used to offer immediate responses when available while up-to-date data
is requested. Here’s a simplified snippet of how this works for fetching
deployments:

```swift
var request = VercelAPI.request(
  for: .deployments(),
  with: session.account.id,
  queryItems: queryItems
)

try session.signRequest(&request)

// Immediately show the cached data
if let cachedResponse = URLCache.shared.cachedResponse(for: request),
  let decodedFromCache = try? JSONDecoder().decode(VercelDeployment.APIResponse.self, from: cachedResponse.data) {
  deployments = decodedFromCache.deployments
}

// Asynchronously fetch the most recent data
let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
let deploymentsResponse = try JSONDecoder().decode(VercelDeployment.APIResponse.self, from: data)
deployments = deploymentsResponse.deployments
```

## Power and Simplicity

Vercel's platform is improving all the time, with recent additions including
storage and Edge configuration. Zeitgeist will never have full feature parity
with Vercel's own platform, but one of the design principles of the app is to
make it as poweful as possible while keeping its interface simple.

It's similar to the difference between a full-fledged toolkit with power tools
and a travel-size screwdriver set. There are times you'd prefer a full toolkit,
but it's amazing what you can do with a few streamlined tools.

Zeitgeist supports environment variable editing, redeploying with or without
build caches, deleting deployments, promoting to production, following build
logs, with a feature list that continues to grow.

<DeviceFrame model={DeviceModel.iPhone14Pro}>
    <MuxVideo
        autoPlay={true}
        playsInline={true}
        poster={18}
        id={"g1nDcw5KW8F2OyFyA01UKXV01TGwfsS01sdPMmfVSpnSdw"}
        muted={true}
        loop={true}
        controls={false}
        width={886}
        height={1920}
    />
</DeviceFrame>

Environment variables are worth looking at in detail. There's a lot of
information associated with environment variables: what targets are they
available in? Are they encrypted, plain text, or secret? Zeitgeist protects
environment variables with on-device biometrics or passcode, and decrypts
encrypted values on-demand to protect sensitive information. The app also lets
you create, update, and delete environment variables. Combined with the ability
to rebuild deployments, this makes it trivial to update an environment variable
and rebuild a deployment to apply those changes, all on your phone.

---

Like most of my side projects, Zeitgeist was built to serve a personal need; I’m
thrilled to see it providing value to so many other developers, too. It's also
one of the most architecturally complex and utilitarian projects in my
portfolio, and a fun challenge to maintain the balance between simplicity and
power.
