Every February in the Eden household, we look forward to tuning in to
[softball](https://www.ncaa.com/sports/softball/d1) season. Being based in the
UK makes it difficult to watch all the games; ESPN and other exclusive rights
holders make it notoriously difficult to stream games outside of the US. But
there's another, more everyday problem: what time the games are happening.

The world clock features built-in to our phones and computers are great at
letting us know what time it is _now_ around the world, but less useful at
answering questions like: What time will it be in London when it’s 5pm in
Clearwater, Florida?

After a couple of years of scratching my brain about these annual questions, I
decided to do something about it by building an app.

## It’s about time

When I was building [Solstice](/portfolio/solstice), many of the bugs I
encountered had something to do with time. Part of this was due to the Time
Travel feature, which allows people to travel through time up to 6 months into
the past or future, to see how the daylight changes.

Spending months solving these bugs and making Time Travel work as intuitively as
possible made me eager to incorporate the feature into another app.

It was fun taking a feature I’d built for traversing time on the order of days
and months, and adapting it for traversing time on the order of hours.

## It’s all in the details

Ora is a wildly simple app—it’s a lot like Solstice’s initial 1.0 release, just
focusing on doing one job well. Creating something really simple meant I could
dedicate less time to building features and fixing bugs, and more time to adding
small details that many will never notice, but reward those who do.

<DeviceFrame model={DeviceModel.iPhone14Pro}>
    <MuxVideo
        autoPlay={true}
        playsInline={true}
        muted={true}
        controls={false}
        loop={true}
        id={"Rzna5BV4uIKEFnLS4N7hkQo39p7swHwiIwwGWX2YfyI"}
    />
</DeviceFrame>

One of Ora’s more subtle details is the relative delay of clocks. The further
away from GMT the time zone is, the longer it takes for the time change to
animate. It’s still only a matter of milliseconds, but adds a sense of distance
between the locations.

<MuxVideo
    className="br-l"
    autoPlay={true}
    playsInline={true}
    muted={true}
    controls={false}
    loop={true}
    id={"p23h02ZkPb6xzOSf6gDbd97Dv6aa01TdVNEVuEnjr00qh00"}
/>

I spent a while adding a subtle highlight edge to the clocks that appear on the
globe. As time travel is adjusted, this highlight slowly moves around the edge
of the container, suggestive of the way the sun’s light changes throughout the
day.

<MuxVideo
    className="br-l"
    autoPlay={true}
    playsInline={true}
    muted={true}
    controls={false}
    loop={true}
    id={"Am9DDgQc2dMDaxujtIuPPkTq8pLHmLWuijXPYNbLtYg"}
/>

There are a couple of places where an animated version of the Ora app icon shows
up. The top navigation icon that toggles the World Clock view animates while
Time Travel is used. The more obviously-animated version appears on the “About”
screen, and hides some details of its own.

As each “segment” of the globe animates from one edge to the other, its opacity
fades from semi-transparent, to opaque, and back again. The stroke width also
varies _ever_ so slightly, suggestive of it actually rotating out of view on a
sphere.

<DeviceFrame model={DeviceModel.iPadPro11M4}>
    <MuxVideo
        autoPlay={true}
        playsInline={true}
        muted={true}
        controls={false}
        loop={true}
        id={"H9otgbV02iILwFNXNtxEZZf9CtmpQ8fkf7lskti6dIIQ"}
    />
</DeviceFrame>

The Time Travel UI didn't look right occupying the full width of the screen on
Ora for iPad, so I made it smaller. It was hard to decide whether it should live
on the left or right bottom corner, so instead, I let people put it in their
corner of preference, making sure it was possible to “flick” it from one side of
the screen to another.

<DeviceFrame model={DeviceModel.iPhone14Pro}>
    <MuxVideo
        autoPlay={true}
        playsInline={true}
        muted={true}
        controls={false}
        loop={true}
        id={"7unk7FdOX02ST6qONonvtx2FjpZf2LYO6nG1Mx01AQTdk"}
    />
</DeviceFrame>

On iPhone, I wanted to have the Time Travel bar always visible (unlike in
Solstice), which meant it had to be as unintrustive as possible. I really like
the playback bar in Apple Music and borrowed some of the same details for Ora,
including the progressive blur that obscures content as it scrolls underneath
it. One detail I added was to give the bottom corners an exaggerated radius to
match the radius of the screen.
