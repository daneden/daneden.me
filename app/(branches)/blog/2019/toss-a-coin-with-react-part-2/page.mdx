In the [first part](/2019/07/29/toss-a-coin-with-react-part-1/) of this
tutorial, we built a simple React app with a button to toss a coin and tell us
which side it landed on.

(You can see the source code of where we left off
[here](https://github.com/daneden/react-coin-toss/tree/549b8db01a10ebaff0766364f3cf48735aa4da21)
and run the app [here](https://coin-toss-1fikjgmoj.now.sh))

In this second part, we're going to start tracking the number of times each side
appears, have the coin tossed automatically for us (rather than having to press
a button) and visualise the results over time.

## Counting Each Side

Currently, our app tracks the total number of times the coin has been tossed,
but you'll remember that from the start, we wanted to know how many times each
side has appeared. Let's change our code to show us that information.

In `App.js`, we'll add a few new variables using `useState`:

```jsx
function App() {
    const [side, setSide] = useState(1)
    const [heads, setHeads] = useState(0)
    const [tails, setTails] = useState(0)

    const tossed = heads + tails

    const tossCoin = () => {
        const landedOn = Math.round(Math.random())

        if (landedOn === 1) {
            setHeads(heads + 1)
        } else {
            setTails(tails + 1)
        }

        setSide(landedOn)
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <p>The coin has been tossed {tossed} times.</p>
            <p>It landed on {side === 1 ? "heads" : "tails"}</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Heads: {heads}</li>
                <li>Tails: {tails}</li>
            </ul>

            <button onClick={tossCoin}>Toss coin</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

We've added four new variables, `heads`, `setHeads`, `tails`, and `setTails`, to
get and set the number of times that heads and tails each appear.

We've removed the `useState` function call that sets `tossed` and `setTossed`
and instead we'll set `const tossed = heads + tails`, just to reduce the number
of "sources of truth" for the total number of times the coin has been tossed.

We've also added a `ul` element to the rendered output where we can see the
values of `heads` and `tails`, but just showing a number isn't very interesting.

## Visualising The Coin Tosses

Thankfully, there's a native HTML element that is perfectly suited for showing
the number of times each side appears out of a total: the `meter` element.

We use the `meter` element like so:

```html
<meter value="50" max="100" />
```

This would render a meter that's filled halfway. Let's use this element to
display how many times each side has landed inside the `ul` we added earlier:

```jsx
<ul>
    <li>
        <label htmlFor="heads">Heads: {heads}</label>
        <meter id="heads" value={heads} max={tossed} />
    </li>
    <li>
        <label htmlFor="tails">Tails: {tails}</label>
        <meter id="tails" value={tails} max={tossed} />
    </li>
</ul>
```

## Automatically Tossing The Coin

The final step in this part of the tutorial will be to have the coin tossed
automatically. To do this, we'll use another React hook: `useEffect`.

The `useEffect` hook is used to call a function whenever a component renders or
is re-rendered (which happens if its properties—props—or state changes). This is
a bit abstract, but it's useful to us: we want to call a function when our app
renders so that we can toss the coin automatically.

In `App.js`, we'll get the `useEffect` hook the same way we get the `useState`
hook:

```jsx
const { useEffect, useState } = React
```

And we'll add a `useEffect` call to our App component. We can add this right
before the `return` statement:

```jsx
...

useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(tossCoin, 500)
  return () => clearInterval(interval)
})

return (
  <div>
    ...
```

This will cause the `tossCoin` function to be called every 500 milliseconds, or
every ½ a second. Note that in the `useEffect` call, we return a function that
clears the interval: this is basically to clean up after ourselves if the App
stops rendering, since we don't then need to keep calling `tossCoin` every
500ms, and doing so could actually lead to bugs or slowness.

You can change the interval to a different value to have the coin tossed more or
less frequently, but it's already very useful: now that the coin is being tossed
automatically, you can see within just a few seconds that the frequency of each
side landing averages out to be about even quite quickly!

Let's make one more change. Now that the coin is tossed automatically, the "toss
coin" button is a bit useless. Let's update our app so that there's a "pause"
button that lets us momentarily stop the automatic tossing and manually toss the
coin again.

```jsx
function App() {
    const [side, setSide] = useState(1)
    const [heads, setHeads] = useState(0)
    const [tails, setTails] = useState(0)
    const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false)

    const tossed = heads + tails

    const tossCoin = () => {
        const landedOn = Math.round(Math.random())

        if (landedOn === 1) {
            setHeads(heads + 1)
        } else {
            setTails(tails + 1)
        }

        setSide(landedOn)
    }

    useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
            if (!isPaused) {
                tossCoin()
            }
        }, 10)
        return () => clearInterval(interval)
    })

    return (
        <div>
            <p>The coin has been tossed {tossed} times.</p>
            <p>It landed on {side === 1 ? "heads" : "tails"}</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <label htmlFor="heads">Heads: {heads}</label>
                    <meter id="heads" value={heads} max={tossed} />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <label htmlFor="tails">Tails: {tails}</label>
                    <meter id="tails" value={tails} max={tossed} />
                </li>
            </ul>

            <button onClick={() => setIsPaused(!isPaused)}>
                {!isPaused ? "Pause" : "Continue"}
            </button>
            {isPaused && <button onClick={tossCoin}>Toss coin</button>}
        </div>
    )
}
```

The complete app code is seen above, with the changes necessary to add the
“pause” button. Let's walk through them together.

We've added an `isPaused` and `setIsPaused` variable to determine whether the
app is running, and set it to `false` by default.

We've changed the `useEffect` callback a bit:

```js
useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
        if (!isPaused) {
            tossCoin()
        }
    }, 10)
    return () => clearInterval(interval)
})
```

Now, we check if `isPaused` is `false` before calling the `tossCoin` function.

Finally, in our rendered output, we add the new “Pause” button, which toggles
the `isPaused` variable, and only show the "toss coin" button if the `isPaused`
variable is false (since `!true` is equal to `false`):

```jsx
(
<button onClick={() => setIsPaused(!isPaused)}>
  {!isPaused ? "Pause" : "Continue"}
</button>
{ isPaused && <button onClick={tossCoin}>Toss coin</button> }
)
```

And that's it! Now our app will automatically toss the coin for us, and show us
a nice visualisation of the number of times each side is shown.

In the next and final part of this tutorial, we'll keep track of the patterns
that emerge—the number of times that each side shows consecutively—and we'll
publish our app publicly using a service called
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/home).
