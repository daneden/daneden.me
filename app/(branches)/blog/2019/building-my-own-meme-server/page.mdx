    title: "Building My Own Meme Server With Dropbox, Netlify, and Zeit Now/Next",
}

In my personal Dropbox, I have a folder with almost 1,000 files inside—gifs,
pngs, and jpeg images. It’s far from a comprehensive collection, but it’s
_mine_; my preferred reaction images, inside jokes, and dumb memes.

Having this Dropbox folder in my Mac’s Dock makes them easy to grab and upload
somewhere, but I’ve also always wanted an easy way for _other_ people to browse
the collection and share the ones they like. I basically wanted something like
[Giphy](https://giphy.com), but with the curation of Ethan Marcotte’s
[bukk.it](https://bukk.it).

I’ve had two major milestones in making this meme server real, and this post is
the story of both of them.

## Attempt #1: Ruby

The [first version](https://github.com/daneden/gifme) of the server took the
shape of a Ruby app, based on Sinatra. The actual Ruby code was pretty simple:
its only job was to route requests for specific files, and to return a list of
available files.

Because I didn't want to check over 1GB of images into a Git repository, I stuck
with Dropbox for storing my images. This presented the first hurdle: I needed to
sync the Dropbox folder to a directory where the Ruby app could reach it.
Because of this, I couldn’t host my Ruby app on Heroku or other managed servers,
since they don’t allow arbitrary file system access.

So here's how the setup ended up:

-   The Ruby app ran on a VPN server of my own
-   Dropbox has a Linux runtime, so I was able to have the Dropbox folder sync
    to the VPN server
-   The images folder was symlinked to a location inside the Ruby app
-   On every HTTP request, Ruby would check the symlinked folder, return the
    list of files, and fulfil the request

This setup worked reasonably well, but it also came with a lot of problems:

-   The Ruby app was eating my VPN's memory up, to the point where more than a
    few concurrent requests would totally crash my server
-   It required a lot of manual labour to ensure the symlinked folder was set up
    correctly, the Dropbox instance was running on my VPN
-   Putting these problems together meant that almost every time I added an
    image to the Dropbox folder, I’d have to SSH into the VPN, make sure the
    Dropbox instance was running, and almost certainly restart the service after
    crashes

All this to say, it was less than ideal. But the final nail in the coffin came
when I decided I didn’t want to pay for a VPN that required a lot of manual
maintenance, when so many newer services (like Netlify, which hosts my current
site, or Heroku, which hosts [Brills](https://brills.me) and some other projects
of mine) took the pain out of running websites.

With the retirement of the VPN in 2017 came the initial retirement of
[gif.daneden.me](https://gif.daneden.me). I always planned to try another
approach, but didn’t find any clear avenue until December 2019.

## Attempt #2: Netlify and Zeit

Two years after shutting down the first attempt, I saw a
[blog post from Jim Nielsen](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/netlify-public-folder-part-i-what/)
that outlined an approach to recreating the Dropbox Public folder. If you don’t
know about this old Dropbox feature, Jim Nielsen’s description of the Public
folder should suffice:

> It was a beautiful idea: you put files in a folder, they sync to Dropbox, then
> instantly become available on the web (via a URL that matches the structure of
> your folder). It was like a modern take on a FTP server, with Dropbox solving
> a lot of the ailments of FTP (security, credentials, file syncing, etc.) Just
> move, copy, or rename some files on your local computer and boom, they’re on
> the web (plus automatically backed up in Dropbox!)

This immediately piqued my interest, since it was pretty much the ideal workflow
for making my memes publically accessible. Jim’s post goes into a lot of depth
about motivation and his
[eventual solution](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/netlify-public-folder-part-iii-how/).
To summarise, Jim ends up using an app called [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com),
which lets you display the output of any script in macOS’s status bar. Jim
kindly shares
[the source code](https://github.com/jimniels/bitbar/blob/master/src/bitbar-scripts/netlify-sync.1m.js)
for his BitBar script, which served as a great starting point.

After some minor changes, I was able to get my Dropbox folder syncing to
Netlify—the first step was complete! Adding an image to my Dropbox triggered a
new upload, and moments later, I could access it on the web via Netlify’s CDN.

Now that the files were up on the web, I was faced by a new challenge. While I
wanted to have a friendly interface for searching for and displaying previews of
the images, I didn’t want to clutter my images folder with source files for HTML
and JavaScript. I didn’t want to change the folder structure at all, so even
adding a `package.json` to run some script once the images were on Netlify’s
network irked me.

Thankfully, I discovered that Netlify’s API makes it possible to
[get a list of files for a given site](https://open-api.netlify.com/#operation/listSiteFiles).
With the images uploaded, and a list of files generated, I could easily create a
separate application to connect everything together.

I chose to use Zeit’s [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) and
[Now](https://github.com/zeit/now), since they offered the easiest way to fetch
data from a server, render React on the server, and deploy a React app with a
simple command.

Altogether, I’m really pleased with [the end result](https://gif.daneden.me),
and will probably have fun making incremental improvements over time. The source
code for the JS client can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/daneden/de-gifs-client).
