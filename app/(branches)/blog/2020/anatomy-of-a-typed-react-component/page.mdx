# Anatomy of a Typed React Component

It's no secret that learning JavaScript (and React) in 2020 is confusing at best
and downright intimidating at worst. Multiple technologies, tools, and
approaches tend to get bundled together in React tutorials, and if you haven't
written JavaScript for a few years, it can feel like a totally new landscape.

In this post, I wanted to take a look at a very simple React component and walk
step-by-step through the parts of the code that are unique to either:

-   React
-   Typed programming (using type checkers such as [Flow](https://flow.org) or
    [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/))
-   "Modern" JavaScript (what's often referred to as "ES6", but essentially
    covers any JavaScript language features that have changed since around 2013,
    which is when I first started learning JavaScript in jQuery’s heyday)

Here's what we'll be looking at, with some markers/annotations in place:

```tsx
// |--- 1 ---|    |--------- 2 ---------||-- 3 --|| 4 |
const Component = ({ children, hasPadding }: Props) => {
    return (
        // |--- 5 ---| |---------- 6 ----------|
        <div className={hasPadding && "padding"}>{children}</div>
    )
}
```

This post assumes some level of competancy with JavaScript, and some of you may
be familiar with the concepts ahead. If you notice anything erroneous in my
explanations, feel free to
[suggest changes](https://github.com/daneden/daneden.me/edit/main/pages/blog/2020/anatomy-of-a-typed-react-component.mdx).

## Table of Contents

## Constants

```tsx
const Component
```

The first marker in our code highlights a keyword that may be new to you:
`const`.

Constants in JavaScript are essentially variables which, once assigned, cannot
be changed. In the past you may have written or seen code that looks like this:

```js
let number = 1
number = 2

console.log(number) // => 2
```

There are sometimes cases where you need to change a variable after it's been
assigned; but most of the time, once it's been set, you don't need to change it.
In fact, leaving it open to change can result in unexpected results. This is
where constants can come in handy.

```js
const number = 1
number = 2 // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

Nowadays, many people follow a rule of "always prefer `const`". If you do need
to assign a variable that may need to change later, `let` is another keyword
that is preferred over `var`:

```js
let number = 1
number = 2

console.log(number) // => 2
```

There are some more differences worth learning about between `var`, `let`, and
`const`, and plenty of [material already written](https://ui.dev/var-let-const/)
on the subject.

## Arrow Functions

Let’s keep on going through that first line, but omitting the `Props` part for
now.

```tsx
({ children, hasPadding }) => { ... }
```

This is a relatively new expression pattern called _arrow functions_. You may be
used to seeing or writing functions like this:

```js
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y
}

add(2, 2) // => 4
```

Arrow functions are "syntactical sugar" that lets you create functions without
the need to use the `function` keyword. We can rewrite the above `add` function
using arrow functions like this:

```js
const add = (x, y) => x + y
```

For simple functions, like `add`, arrow functions can be a little easier to read
since it lets you see the arguments and returned value in just one line. (Notice
also that we can omit the `{}` curly braces and `return` keyword for simple
expressions.)

One important thing to note about arrow functions is that they come without
bindings to the `this` value. The `this` value is essentially a value
representing the context from which a function or expression is called, and
arrow functions somewhat skip a level:

```js
const myObject = {
    foo: 1,
    // A regular function
    withThis() {
        console.log(this)
    },
    // An arrow function
    withoutThis: () => {
        console.log(this)
    },
}

myObject.withThis() // logs myObject
myObject.withoutThis() // logs Window
```

For the most part, this shouldn't have much of an impact on your day-to-day
JavaScript, but it's worth calling out as the cause of some occasional bugs when
dealing with functions.

## Destructuring Assignment

Something new is going on in the arguments for that arrow function:

```js
// |------ here -------|
({ children, hasPadding }) => { ... }
```

This expression is called a "destructuring assignment", and it makes a bit more
sense in a slightly different form:

```js
(props) => {
    const { children, hasPadding } = props
    ...
}
```

You likely already know that curly braces in JavaScript can be used to
initialize an `Object`. What you're seeing above isn't altogether different;
what this expression is doing is assigning the _properties_ `children` and
`hasPadding` of the object `props` to new variables with the same name. It's the
same as writing this:

```js
const props = {
    children: "A string value",
    hasPadding: true,
}

const children = props.children
const hasPadding = props.hasPadding
```

The syntax also works for arrays:

```js
const myArray = [1, 2, 3]

const [first, second, third] = myArray

// The above line could also be written as:
const first = myArray[0]
const second = myArray[1]
const third = myArray[2]
```

Like with arrow functions, destructuring assignment is a convenient syntactical
sugar that helps us write less, and often (though not always) more readable,
code.

One more thing to know about destructuring assignment is that you can assign any
remaining values in an object or an array using what's called a _spread
operator_. It looks like this:

```js
const myProfile = {
    name: "Daniel Eden",
    age: 29,
    bio: "Designer, writing and thinking about design systems",
    favouriteDessert: "Sticky toffee pudding",
    tags: ["design", "london", "bread"],
}

const { name, age, ...rest } = myProfile
console.log(rest) // { bio, favouriteDessert, tags }

const [firstTag, ...tags] = rest.tags
console.log(tags) // ["london", "bread"]
```

## Type Signatures

Let's look at one last part of the first line of our React component, indicated
at marker 3 in our code snippet at the top:

```tsx
//                                        |-- 3 --|
const Component = ({ children, hasPadding }: Props) => {
```

This is the first non-native-JavaScript part of our code so far! Everything
you've seen up to this point is totally valid, modern JavaScript. What you're
seeing here is called a _type expression_, and for JavaScript to understand it,
the code would first need to be run through a type checker, such as
[Flow](https://flow.org) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

I've [written a little](/blog/2019/typed-systems) about typed programming
before, but here's a brief primer for those unfamiliar. When code is “typed”, it
doesn't mean “typed with a keyboard”, but that the values that are created and
passed around a program have _expected types_ that describe the _kind_ of values
they represent.

Here are some example _type expressions_:

```tsx
const myNumber: number = 42
const myString: string = "Hello"
```

What this tells the type checker (and the people reading or editing this code)
is that the variable `myNumber` should be a `number` type, and `myString` should
be a `string` type. We can intentionally introduce an error into this code:

```tsx
const myNumber: string = 42
// TypeError: Type '42' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

The type checker would helpfully let us know that the value `42` is incompatible
with the requested type `string`.

Looking back at our `add` function from the [arrow functions](#arrow-functions)
section, we can take a look at how types can help us write safer code. For
example, it doesn't make sense for the `add` function to add together a string
and a number:

```js
add(2, 2) // => 4
add(3, "4") // => "34"
```

Introducing type signatures to our code can help us avoid this error:

```tsx
const add = (x: number, y: number): number => x + y

add(2, 2) // 4
add(3, "4") // TypeError: Argument of type '"4"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

Let's take a look back at our React component.

```tsx
const Component = ({ children, hasPadding }: Props) => { ... }
```

From the type signature, we can see that the object containing the properties
`children` and `hasPadding` should be an object matching the `Props` type. If we
rewrite the code so it doesn't use a destructuring assignment, that may be a bit
easier to see:

```tsx
const Component = (props: Props) => { ... }
```

I haven't included the type definition for `Props` yet, but let's imagine it
looks something like this:

```tsx
interface Props {
    children?: React.ReactNode
    hasPadding: boolean
    onClick?: () => void
}
```

The `Props` definition tells me that the argument passed to `Component` should
be an object with the following properties:

-   `children`, which is an optional property (as indicated by the question mark
    in `children?:`) and should have a value of the `React.ReactNode` type
-   `hasPadding`, which is a `Boolean` (`true` or `false`)
-   `onClick`, which is an optional property and should be a _function_ that has
    no return value (`void`)

As you can see, the Props definition has more information about the properties
passed to the component. Not only does this help me understand the component a
little more, but TypeScript will also warn me if I use the component
incorrectly:

```tsx
<Component onClick={false} />
/**
 * TypeError: type '{ onClick }' is missing the following properties: children, hasPadding
 * TypeError: type 'false' is not assignable to type '(() => void) | undefined' in 'onClick'
 **/
```

We're skipping ahead here, but trying to use `Component` in React without giving
values for `children` or `hasPadding` shows an error, and we have another error
for the value of `onClick`.

## React and JSX

Whew, 1,500 words into this post and we've only covered a single line of code!
Hopefully the explanations so far have helped you develop a better sense for how
to understand more modern JavaScript code and typed JavaScript. Now, we're going
to get into the meat of React and a syntactical sugar introduced by React called
_JSX_.

Let's look again at our original `Component` definition:

```tsx
const Component = ({ children, hasPadding }: Props) => {
    return (
        // |--- 5 ---| |---------- 6 ----------|
        <div className={hasPadding && "padding"}>{children}</div>
    )
}
```

The first two lines should now be familiar to you.

1. In the first line we'll instantiate a constant `Component` with a value that
   is a function. The function accepts a single argument with the type of
   `Props`. We'll destructure that argument into two values, `children` and
   `hasPadding`.
2. We'll begin the `return` statement, which continues onto the next line(s)

And this is where things get interesting. Right away, we see `<div>` in the
return value, which is odd. The `<` symbol is a _logical operator_ in
JavaScript, used to compare values—in this case, it checks that the left-hand
value is less than the right-hand value. But in this case, there is no left-hand
value, and `div` isn't something we've defined—what's going on?

---

You may recognise `<div>` as HTML code, which is a good hunch! What you're
seeing is another syntactical sugar, introduced by React, called _JSX_. JSX lets
you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

When a code compiler encounters JSX, it gets transformed into a format that
native JavaScript can understand, similar to how typed code needs to be run
through a type checker first. In the case of JSX and React, the transformed code
is a series of React functions. Let's look at a rudimentary example.

```jsx
const myJsxCode = <h1 className="greeting">Hello, world</h1>

const myTransformedCode = React.createElement(
    "h1", // 1
    { className: "greeting" }, // 2
    "Hello, world" // 3
)
```

These two variable assignments are identical. Let's step through the arguments
passed to `React.createElement` to understand how a code compiler transforms
JSX.

1. The first argument to `React.createElement` is the _element name_ or
   reference. In this case, we're using one of React’s built-in HTML elements,
   `h1`, which is passed as a string literal.
2. The second argument is the _properties_ or `props` argument. In the case of
   HTML elements, these are usually the attributes that are added, but props can
   be any value, as seen in our custom `Props` type definition earlier in the
   post.
3. The third argument represents the _children_ of the element. In this case,
   it's just a string that says `"Hello, world"`, but it could be more calls
   to`React.createElement` to create nested elements.

Let's rewrite that function call and arguments as JSX with annotations once
more:

```jsx
//                (1) (2)                   (3)
const myJsxCode = <h1 className="greeting">Hello, world</h1>
```

The `children` property is special insofar as it can either be passed in between
the opening and closing tags for a React element, or it can be passed just like
other properties. In other words, the code above can be rewritten as:

```jsx
const myJsxCode = <h1 className="greeting" children="Hello, world" />

const myTransformedCode = React.createElement("h1", {
    className: "greeting",
    children: "Hello, world",
})
```

---

Now that we understand a bit about JSX, let's look at our component again:

```tsx
const Component = ({ children, hasPadding }: Props) => {
    return (
        // |--- 5 ---| |---------- 6 ----------|
        <div className={hasPadding && "padding"}>{children}</div>
    )
}
```

The part of the code indicated by marker 6 is a _JSX embedded expression_. It's
just a JavaScript expression written inside a JSX call by surrounding it in
curly braces. In this case, `hasPadding && "padding"` is a boolean expression
that checks if `hasPadding` is true and returns "padding". If `hasPadding` is
false, the whole expression will return `false`.

There's another embedded expression surrounding `children`. This just tells
JavaScript/JSX to output the contents of `children`.

Note that JSX embedded expressions can only be _expressions_—statements that
produce a value. For example, you can't put an `if...else` statement inside a
JSX embedded expression since `if...else` statements don't have to return a
value. You can, however, use _ternary operators_ to check a condition:

```tsx
const Switch = ({ isOn }: { isOn: boolean }) => (
    <div>The switch is {isOn ? "on!" : "off."}</div>
)
```

If you're unfamiliar with ternary operators, they work like this:

```
condition ? {true value} : {false value}
```

You can expect to see them with some regularity in React code, since they're
useful for conditionally rendering different results based on a component's
properties.
