-   Everyone is kind of messed up. It’s best we talk more about it.
-   People are, generally speaking, well-meaning and kind. That’s a difficult
    and important thing to remember.
-   Loving something is a privilege not everyone will have. Hold on to it. Chase
    it.
-   Loving relationships require complete and utter selflessness. It’s easy when
    it’s right.
-   It’s very easy to hold on to hate. It’s very difficult to live that way.
-   If you use something every day, it’s best to invest in the best possible
    version of that thing. It’ll drive you mad if you don’t.
-   You’re only really ever limited by yourself.
-   Humility and kindness trumps authority.
-   Extraordinary things don’t happen to passive people.
-   Everything will be OK in the end. If it’s not OK, it isn’t the end.
