It's a new year, and although it's a bit late, I'm pleased to get stuck into the
third and final part of our journey with React. If you remember from
[part one](/2019/07/29/toss-a-coin-with-react-part-1/), we started this exercise
with the idea of tossing a coin forever and seeing how it averages out to a
roughly equal number of heads vs. tails; but there's still one thing missing
from our coin-tossing simulation:

> There will be stretches of perfect fullness, consisting of a long run of 1’s.
> There will be stretches of perfect emptiness, consisting of a long run of 0’s.

How are we to track these stretches? That's what we'll solve for in this final
installment, before deploying our simulator onto the web with a simple command.

To track the record number of consecutive 1's and 0's, we're going to use many
of the same tools we've used, with the introduction of one new function.

```jsx
import React from "react"

const { useEffect, useRef, useState } = React

function App() {
  const [side, setSide] = useState(1)

  const prevSide = useRef(side)
  const [heads, setHeads] = useState(0)
  const [tails, setTails] = useState(0)
  const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false)

  const [currentStretch, setCurrentStretch] = useState(0)
  const [headsRecord, setHeadsRecord] = useState(0)
  const [tailsRecord, setTailsRecord] = useState(0)

  const tossed = heads + tails
  // ...
```

We've added a few lines to `App.js`. First, from React, we want to grab one new
function: `useRef`. In React, a "ref" is a variable that:

1. Is mutable (can be changed easily just by assigning it a new value)
2. Persists throughout a component's lifecycle (meaning it sticks around for as
   long as the component is rendered)

Usually, refs are used to allow developers to interact with

<abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> elements directly (as opposed to managing
them through React's component lifecycle), but in this case, we're going to use it
to store the previous result of the coin toss.

We'll initialise `prevSide` to equal `side`, and we'll refer to it later in the
`tossCoin` function:

```jsx
const [side, setSide] = useState(1)
const prevSide = useRef(side)
```

We also need a few variables to keep track of the current stretch of consecutive
heads or tails, as well as the record number of consecutive heads and tails
respectively. We can use good old `useState` once more, and we'll initialise
each of the values as `0` since on the first render, no records have been set.

```jsx
const [currentStretch, setCurrentStretch] = useState(0)
const [headsRecord, setHeadsRecord] = useState(0)
const [tailsRecord, setTailsRecord] = useState(0)
```

**Interlude: What's Happening When We Call `useState`?**

We've used `useState` quite a lot in our app so far—7 times to my count—but you
might be wondering exactly what `useState` _does_, and why we don't store our
state variables some other way, like using a regular old `var` or in an Object.

Imagine you’re at a restaurant with a bunch of your friends, giving your order
to the waitstaff. In this analogy, React is the waitstaff and your orders are
calls to `useState`.

The waitstaff is going to write your orders down in an ordered list, which
they’ll read back to you later. Half way through your order, one of your friends
might say “actually, I changed my mind—I’d like the steak instead of the salad.”

If we were to write the code for this scenario, it might look like this:

```js
const [order, changeOrder] = useState("salad")
```

And later, when our friend changes their order:

```js
changeOrder("steak")
```

When `changeOrder` is called (your friend changes their mind), the waitstaff
(React) goes through their list of orders, finds the one that your friend
originally made, scratches it out, and changes it to the new order.

This is a simplification, but not a big one: state variables, when managed by
`useState`, is just a list/array of values that changes over time. What's
important in the management of this list of values is that _React is in control
of when the values change_. Giving control of the values over to React helps to
ensure that our application stays fast and only updates when necessary.

---

Let's get back to our app. Now that we've got variables for our records, and a
reference letting us know which side of the coin appeared on the _previous_
toss, we need to update the `tossCoin` function to properly update those
variables. Here's what our `tossCoin` function will look like after these
updates:

```jsx
const tossCoin = () => {
    const landedOn = Math.round(Math.random())

    if (landedOn !== prevSide.current) {
        switch (landedOn) {
            case 0:
                setTailsRecord(Math.max(currentStretch, tailsRecord))
                break
            case 1:
            default:
                setHeadsRecord(Math.max(currentStretch, headsRecord))
                break
        }
        setCurrentStretch(1)
        prevSide.current = landedOn
    } else {
        setCurrentStretch(currentStretch + 1)
    }

    if (landedOn === 1) {
        setHeads(heads + 1)
    } else {
        setTails(tails + 1)
    }

    setSide(landedOn)
}
```

Note that the whole block is inside an `if` statement. We only run this code if
the most recent coin toss has a different result than the previous one:
basically if a streak of either heads or tails ends.

I’m introducing a new syntax you may not be familiar with called a _switch
statement_. A switch statement lets us check the value of a variable, and
execute code depending on that value. It's a bit like an `if` statement, but
saves us from a lot of `else if` checks.

In this case, we're checking which side the coin landed on, and updating the
corresponding record. Here's that switch statement again, with comments to help
clarify what's happening:

```js
// Given the `landedOn` value...
switch (landedOn) {
    // If the coin landed on tails,
    case 0:
        // Update the tails record to `currentStretch` or
        // `tailsRecord`, whichever is highest
        setTailsRecord(Math.max(currentStretch, tailsRecord))
        // `break` the switch and go back outside the switch
        // statement, since our condition was met.
        break

    // If the coin landed on heads,
    case 1:
    // Or if we encounter a different value (this shouldn't
    // happen, but it's important to make our code safe
    // against bugs)
    default:
        // Update the tails record to `currentStretch` or
        // `headsRecord`, whichever is highest
        setHeadsRecord(Math.max(currentStretch, headsRecord))
        // `break` the switch and go back outside the switch
        // statement, since our condition was met.
        break
}
```

Whew! Take a minute to re-read that code and make sure you understand what's
happening.

Immediately after the switch statement, we reset the current record. Because the
record began when the current coin face is different to the previous coin face,
the current face's record starts with `1`. We also want to set the `prevSide`
reference to the current coin face.

```js
setCurrentStretch(1)
prevSide.current = landedOn
```

One more thing: if the current coin face **is** the same as the previous one, we
should increment the `currentStretch` value! Putting the lot together (and
skipping past the switch statement since we looked at it in detail already)
looks like this:

```js
// If the streak has ended...
if (landedOn !== prevSide.current) {
    // The `switch` statement goes here and updates the
    // record for heads or tails

    // Reset the current record
    setCurrentStretch(1)
    // And update the reference for future checks
    prevSide.current = landedOn
} else {
    // Otherwise, the streak is still going!
    setCurrentStretch(currentStretch + 1)
}
```

Now that we've added all the logic we need to keep track of the streaks of
consecutive heads or tails, all we need to do is render the output.

Find the `return` value for our component and add the code to render the
records:

```jsx
return (
    <div>
        {/* Code from parts 1 & 2... */}
        <h2>Records</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Heads: {headsRecord}</li>
            <li>Tails: {tailsRecord}</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
)
```

And that's it! After making these updates, you should now see a changing record
of the number of consecutive heads and tails. You might notice that the records
quickly change from 0 to about 5 or 6, and then much more slowly increase to 10
or so, before slowing down completely and only increasing every now and then.

This isn't surprising! Try it yourself at home by tossing a coin: you'll find
that consecutive runs of heads or tails are quite rare, but if you were to toss
a coin many thousands or millions of times, eventually you might find incredibly
long streaks of heads or tails. (Luckily, we built this app to simulate those
coin tosses happening much more quickly!)

You can see the full `App.js` code up to this point
[here](https://github.com/daneden/react-coin-toss/blob/a231205b82af0d1217f988509763ab7fecc363f6/src/App.js).

## The Final Step: Deploying Our App

Once you've built a React application, you'll want to deploy it for the world to
see. Thankfully, nowadays deploying a React app is made easy by services that
let you do it for free and quickly!

One of those services is called [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home/). Assuming you
have `npm` or `yarn` installed, as in
[Part 1](/2019/07/29/toss-a-coin-with-react-part-1/), you can install the
`vercel` command line tool like so:

```bash
npm install --global vercel
```

Or for Yarn:

```bash
yarn global add vercel
```

Once installed, from inside your React application's directory, simply type
`vercel` and hit enter. Vercel will show you your app being uploaded to their
servers and then give you a URL where you—or anyone across the globe—can see
your app running live!

You may have noticed that I’ve been using Vercel for all the live instances of
my application throughout this series of posts.
[Here's the latest version](https://react-coin-toss-4hyc5jf7k.now.sh) of our
coin toss application running on Vercel.

## Wrapping Up

What a journey we've been on! We learned a bit about React, its syntax, and how
to leverage its component lifecycle with `useState` and `useEffect`; we've
looked at JavaScript features like object destructuring and switch statements;
and we've deployed a React application to a web server for the world to see!

I hope these posts have been interesting—even helpful—for people curious about
React, and that you find ways to take some of the concepts introduced here and
build some fun things of your own.

As a bonus, I updated the coin toss application one more time with some style
changes and a slider to let people control how often our virtual coin is tossed.
You can always find the latest version of the application
[here](https://react-coin-toss.daneden.now.sh/) and see its code
