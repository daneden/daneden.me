    This is the first in a short series of posts explaining how to build a React
    application that simulates tossing a coin over and over again. Read{" "}

    when you’re done here!
</Note>

I've never written a React tutorial before—there are plenty of people more
qualified than me to do so—but I was recently reading
["Why Does the World Exist?" by Jim Holt](https://amzn.to/318ym89), which
contained a passage that moved me to tinker with an idea:

> Think of an infinite sequence of random coin tosses: 1 for “heads,” 0 for
> “tails.” Even though the sequence as a whole will be patternless, it is
> guaranteed to contain—by pure chance—all conceivable local patterns. There
> will be stretches of perfect fullness, consisting of a long run of 1’s. There
> will be stretches of perfect emptiness, consisting of a long run of 0’s.

Upon reading this, I thought it would be nice to visualise these coin tosses,
seeing the longest streaks of heads-versus-tails, as well as how the average
ends up over time.

Over a series of a handful of posts, I hope to walk through doing this in a
simple React app, making use of React's hooks, and deploying this little toy on
a service called Now, allowing other people to run the simulation on their
computers too.

## Prerequisites

This post will assume at least a little knowledge about how to use the command
line. Nothing terribly complex; navigating between folders with `cd`, and
installing things with `npm` or `yarn`.

Which brings me to the other prerequisite: you should make sure you have
[node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. I'm going to
be using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), an alternative to npm, but for the
most part, the two are interchangable:

| yarn                 | npm                     |
| :------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `yarn add {package}` | `npm install {package}` |
| `yarn start`         | `npm start`             |

I'm also assuming you're a little familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You
might have written a portfolio website, or tinkered with Neopets, or work
closely with developers in your job. If you aren't familiar with these
languages, you might have a little difficulty following the post, but hopefully
you can follow along and learn _just enough to be dangerous_.

## Creating a React App

The first step is the simplest one, thanks to a tool called
[create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/). Assuming you
have a recent version of node installed, open up the command line, navigate
somewhere you'd like your app to live, and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app coin-toss
```

This will create a new folder, `coin-toss`, and populate it with all the code
you need to run an example React application. When the `create-react-app`
command is finished, it will instruct you to do the following:

```bash
cd coin-toss
yarn start
```

Go ahead and do that. You should see that a development server starts running,
and your browser should open and take you to a `localhost` web page, where you
see the example React app running.

If you need to stop or restart the development server at any time, you can press
`Ctrl + C` and then run `yarn start` to begin it again.

Congratulations! Strictly speaking, you've just created your first React app! If
running the example code has left you a little underwhelmed, don't fret: next,
we'll start to write some custom code for our application.

The first thing we need to do in our app is have it simulate the basic exercise
of tossing a coin. Let's change our app so that it has a button to toss an
imaginary coin and then tells us the result.

## Step 1: Removing The Example Code

Open up the `coin-toss` folder in your code editor of choice (I'm using
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) and you should see the
following contents:

```md
node_modules public src ↳ App.css ↳ App.js ↳ App.test.js ↳ index.css ↳ index.js
↳ logo.svg ↳ serviceWorker.js .gitignore package.json README.md yarn.lock
```

Open up `src/App.js`. We’re going to delete most of the code already inside it,
but feel free to copy-and-paste if it's easier.

<Note>
    If the code syntax in this file is new to you, don’t worry: React introduces
    a few new concepts, but we’ll walk through it together.
</Note>

We'll delete some of the import statements at the top and most of the code in
the `App` function. Here's what your `App.js` should look like:

```jsx
import React from "react"

function App() {
    return <div>The coin toss app will go here!</div>
}

export default App
```

If the development server is still running, in your web browser you should now
see that your app is just a page that says “The coin toss app will go here!”.

Since we deleted the references to `logo.svg` and `App.css` in `App.js`, we can
also delete those files:

```diff
  node_modules
  public
  src
- ↳ App.css
  ↳ App.js
  ↳ App.test.js
  ↳ index.css
  ↳ index.js
- ↳ logo.svg
  ↳ serviceWorker.js
  .gitignore
  package.json
  README.md
  yarn.lock
```

**Interlude: Understanding React's JSX Syntax**: Let's go back to `App.js` for a
moment. If you haven't seen React code before, seeing HTML-like bracketed-code
might be a surprise to you:

```jsx
import React from "react"

function App() {
    return <div>The coin toss app will go here!</div>
}

export default App
```

This is called JSX syntax, and it's just a convenient way of writing React code.
The line above could also be written like this:

```js
return React.createElement("div", null, "The coin toss app will go here!")
```

When we write `<div>` in JSX, it's telling React to create a `div` element,
without any additional properties or attributes ("props" in React), with _"The
coin toss app will go here!"_ as its contents (or "children").

The `create-react-app` command, in addition to providing us with some starter
code, also enabled us to write JSX syntax so that we didn't have to write
functions like above.

---

## Step 2: Adding The "Toss Coin" Button

Let's add the "toss coin" button to our app. We can place a button inside the
`div` already in our code. Let's update the `App` function like so:

```jsx
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            The coin toss app will go here!
            <button>Toss coin</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

<Note>
    Note that here I’ve excluded the <Code>import</Code> and <Code>export</Code>{" "}
    lines just to focus on the <Code>App</Code> function; be sure not to delete
    them from your code.
</Note>

Save your changes and check the web browser: we now have a button, but clicking
it doesn't do anything yet. Let's change that:

```jsx
function App() {
    const tossCoin = () => {
        alert("The coin was tossed")
    }

    return (
        <div>
            The coin toss app will go here!
            <button onClick={tossCoin}>Toss coin</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

Now, when you click the button, the browser should show a dialog that says "The
coin was tossed".

In addition to having the `tossCoin` function, we need to actually have our
virtual coin so that we can tell which side it landed on. Like the excerpt from
the book at the start of the page, we'll represent the sides with a 1 for
"heads" and a 0 for "tails".

To manage our coin, we'll use something called the _`useState` hook_. A "hook"
in React is just a function that takes advantage of React's "component
lifecycle", which determines when a component or an app should update.

`useState` lets us define a variable and provides a function for updating that
variable later on. We'll need one for the coin's side, and one for the number of
times the coin has been tossed.

```jsx
import React from "react"

const { useState } = React

function App() {
    const [side, setSide] = useState(1)
    const [tossed, setTossed] = useState(0)

    const tossCoin = () => {
        const landedOn = Math.round(Math.random())
        setSide(landedOn)
        setTossed(tossed + 1)
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <p>The coin has been tossed {tossed} times.</p>
            <p>It landed on {side === 1 ? "heads" : "tails"}</p>
            <button onClick={tossCoin}>Toss coin</button>
        </div>
    )
}

export default App
```

Let's walk through the changes we just made.

```js
const { useState } = React
```

This might be unfamiliar syntax again. This is called _object
destructuring_[^1], and it's the same as writing:

```js
const useState = React.useState
```

This code makes the `useState` hook available in `App.js`. Next, we update the
`tossCoin` function to use the hook and set some new variables:

```js
const [side, setSide] = useState(1)
const [tossed, setTossed] = useState(0)
```

This might be new as well! This is another form of destructuring. The `useState`
function returns an array of two values: the state variable, and the function to
update the state variable. The first line above can be re-written as:

```js
const result = useState(1)
const side = result[0]
const setSide = result[1]
```

Looking back to the previous code sample, we're setting four new variables:

-   `side`, which will initially be `1`
-   `setSide`
-   `tossed`, which will initially be `0`
-   and `setTossed`

We'll use the `side` and `tossed` variables to keep track of which side of the
coin we see and how many times it's been tossed, and `setSide` and `setTossed`
to update them respectively.

Our `tossCoin` function has been updated too:

```js
const tossCoin = () => {
    const landedOn = Math.round(Math.random())
    setSide(landedOn)
    setTossed(tossed + 1)
}
```

`landedOn` is set to either 1 or 0. The `Math.random` function will return a
random floating point number between 0 and 1, so we just take that value and
round it to the nearest whole number.

Next, we call the `setSide` function with our `landedOn` value to tell our app
which side of the coin we see, and `setTossed` to increase the `tossed` value
by 1.

Finally, the `return` value of `App` has been updated to show two paragraphs:

```jsx
<p>The coin has been tossed {tossed} times.</p>
<p>It landed on {side === 1 ? "heads" : "tails"}</p>
```

Here, we're using the `tossed` variable to indicate how many times we've tossed
our virtual coin. The curly braces are there to tell React/JSX that we'd like to
use a JavaScript variable.

In the next paragraph, we're checking if the `side` variable is equal to `1`. If
it is, we'll output "heads", and if it isn't, we'll output "tails".

Putting all of this together, we can now go back to the browser and click the
"Toss coin" button, and it will update with the number of times it's been
tossed, along with which side of the coin is seen. If you keep pressing the
button, you'll already start to see some of the patterns mentioned in the
excerpt: long sequences of 0's, followed by long sequences of 1's, followed by
interwoven 0's and 1's.

If you've made it this far, you should feel proud! We've made a React app that
responds to user input and dynamically updates.

**Part 1 Conclusion: The Power of React**: If you're like me, it's probably
taking (or did take) a while to warm up to the idea of React. Why would I prefer
it over regular JavaScript or jQuery? Why does it seem so different from
everything else I've learned about JavaScript?

Hopefully by following this tutorial you've started to feel a little of React's
power come into play. What I've found really appealing about React is that it is
highly <mark>declarative</mark> and it is <mark>reactive</mark>.

By _declarative_, I mean that rather than describing the steps you take to make
an element or a variable a certain way, you just describe the element straight
away. Let's look at an example in classic JavaScript:

```js
const button = document.createElement("button")
button.innerHTML = "Toss coin"
button.addEventListener("click", tossCoin)
```

And compare it to the JSX/React code:

```jsx
<button onClick={tossCoin}>Toss coin</button>
```

Especially in larger codebases, writing declarative UI code like this can make
managing the codebase much easier.

Secondly, when I say _reactive_, I'm describing one of the side effects of
declarative code, and a feature that React in particular makes available to us.

Notice how in our application, because we're writing our code declaratively, and
we're letting React handle many of our variables using `useState`, we don't have
to manually update variables like `side` or `tosses`, and we don't have to
change any inner HTML of the paragraph elements of our app. In classic JS, we'd
likely have to update a lot of things ourselves:

```js
const firstParagraph = document.createElement("p")
firstParagraph.innerHTML = `The coin has been tossed ${tossed} times.`

// ...much later or elsewhere in our code
tossed = tossed + 1
firstParagraph.innerHTML = `The coin has been tossed ${tossed} times.`
```

By writing our code declaratively with the help of React, we need only write our
paragraph once, and everything updates automatically whenever `tossed` or other
variables change or update.

---

In the next part of this series, we'll start to count the total number of times
that each side of the coin appears, and visualise them using HTML elements.
We'll also have our coin flipped automatically for us, so that you don't have to
press a button each time.

While waiting for the next post, consider how you might achieve those next steps
yourself, or what other creative ways you could use what you've learned in this
first part.
