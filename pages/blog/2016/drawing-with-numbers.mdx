I’ve never considered myself much of an artist. My creativity has always found
its home in design and photography, practices which feel far less dependent on
natural creativity and talent. I can’t draw; I try to stay away from paint;
sculpting is one of those things that _sounds_ more fun to me than it actually
is.

I have, however, become deeply interested in generative art. How numbers can be
governed to create visually interesting works, with seemingly complex but
gratifyingly simple sets of rules. It’s hard to trace where this interest really
began, but I think it started in the
[Dia:Beacon](http://www.diaart.org/visit/visit/diabeacon-beacon-united-states)
gallery in New York.

The Dia:Beacon is probably one of my favorite places on Earth. A vast, expansive
gallery with astonishing works of art, ranging from Richard Serra’s immersive
and imposing sculptures, to delicate and easily-missed installations from Fred
Sandback. One collection that stuck with me is the work of Sol LeWitt. One piece
features thousands, perhaps millions, of hand-drawn lines, in a variety of
patterns. The cumulative effect of line after line creates an array of sometimes
wildly different visualizations.

The dedication and vision to create installations like this was boggling. It
made me itch to create. I can’t draw, but I _can_ tell computers to draw for me.

## Humble Beginnings

My “sketches” started with one goal; to recreate a design I first saw on the
back of one of Dropbox’s design team sweatshirts, created by
[Kristen Spilman](https://twitter.com/kspilman). It’s simple enough—an array of
rectangles, each rotated so they’re pointing towards a point in space.

<Image

/>

I started by trying to recreate this design with a single rectangle using HTML
canvas. This taught me two things:

1. I had forgotten most of what I learned in high school maths
2. HTML canvas can only get you so far (on its own)

Thanks to some light tuition in mathematics from
[Allen Rabinovich](http://www.allenrabinovich.com/) and some persistence, I had
a functioning prototype of the design. During the course of building the first
prototype, I stumbled across [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a JavaScript library
that _“makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and
beginners”_. Thankfully, this description also works in reverse; it makes art
and design accessible for people fluent in coding, by providing a comprehensive
drawing toolkit.

I moved what I had learned into a p5 sketch, and before long, I had a real-life
version of what I had first set out to create.

## Graduating From JavaScript

I owe a lot of what I learned about p5.js and, in turn, Processing, to
[Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/). Thanks to his energizing videos[^1], I
found myself creating sketches in p5.js several times a day. The ease of use
meant I could have an idea, and within minutes have a little working prototype
in my browser.

Over time, my ideas became bigger, and my browser became slower. When I would
(occasionally) create a long-running loop, such as drawing tens of thousands of
points, my browser would stagger to a halt. It was time to graduate to something
more capable.

Processing, the Java library upon which p5.js is based, was the solution. I had
never written Java before, but since it was so syntactically similar to
JavaScript, with just a few Google searches, I was able to start porting over
some of my more ambitious p5.js sketches into Processing.

/>

A more performant environment and toolkit meant I could work on more demanding
and expressive ideas. Instead of drawing hundreds of points to a canvas, I could
draw thousands. The only limit now was my own creativity.

## New Frontiers

Unfortunately, creativity isn’t my strong suit. My design process is a tribute
to this; I typically resort to long-lived solutions and the safety of design
systems. This is usually a strength in my day-to-day, but in this new world of
creative output, I found it hard to generate new ideas. So, like any great
artist, I started stealing ideas.

If I saw a photograph or a tweet showing interesting visual forms, I’d set off
and try to recreate it or express it using Processing. Murmurations of
starlings; ocean waves crashing; pulsating wind farms; smoke patterns. I also
sought out other artists to spark inspiration, the greatest sources becoming
[Anders Hoff](http://inconvergent.net/)—who helped me realize the beauty and
simplicity[^2] of the algorithms I was starting to write—and
[Jessica Rosenkrantz](https://twitter.com/nervous_jessica) of
[Nervous System](http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/), whose algorithms and works continue
to fuel a growing ambition.

I started moving my focus from motion towards sketches that gave the
_impression_ of motion, be it through the apparent movement of their lines, or
the stages of evolution they exhibited.

## Making It Real

With my Processing folder growing in size, and hundreds of stills and movies
being saved on my hard drive, I wanted to explore bringing these works outside
of their digital home and into the real world through print. Printing the pieces
I was generating meant introducing additional dimensionality to them—the
opportunity to play with colors and ink saturations, paper types and weights,
print speeds and the kinds of happy accidents that typos alone don’t afford.

After some trial and error, my first prints were born, and along with them, a
torrent of new ideas. Each new print would prompt another, developing a series
and planting seeds for evolved ideas.

Exploring generative art through Processing has not only given me a creative
outlet and a medium to express ideas, but it's helping me become a more
proficient programmer and a more creative designer. It's also given me a reason
to finally explore print as a medium and produce physical works that I can keep
and give to friends. You can't really _give_ someone a website.

I'm keen to learn more about this space, and it's leading me to more fertile
ground for learning—artificial intelligence and programming natural systems
seems like a small(er) step after dabbling in these algorithms.

    Daniel’s videos on YouTube showed the successes and stumbles of writing
    JavaScript in a way I hadn’t seen before—I highly recommend subscribing to
    [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman).

    Anders’ [Generative](http://inconvergent.net/generative/) visual essay
    brings clarity to his beautiful work, and gave me a new perspective on how
    expressive the simplest ideas can be when the only variable is time
    (provided you can be patient enough for the results to be pleasing)
