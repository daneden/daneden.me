In my posts about Design Systems so far, I’ve theorized about the structural
approach that causes existing design systems to fail, and an
[alternative solution](/2017/03/29/designing-systems/) that encourages the
composition of properties instead of cataloguing complete components. However, a
suite of style properties and simple, functional components gives an
overwhelming array of options for composing them.

I’ve used the word “vocabulary” to describe a design system before—a collection
of metaphorical nouns and verbs that allow designers, engineers and beyond to
express their intent in building a product—but what good is an expansive
vocabulary without rules to govern how words may be used together? “Colossal
dredging qualm reverence” contains some relatively advanced vocabulary, but the
phrase as a whole has no meaning. Put another way, what use is a pantry full of
ingredients if you don’t know how to combine them in a way that makes an
appetising meal?

## Defining a Pattern Language

I’ve recently been thumbing through a book that had been on my wish list for
some time: [A Pattern Language](http://amzn.to/2t5tX9d), a comprehensive title
cataloguing some 250 patterns for construction and city planning. Each pattern
is defined with the following structure:

1. The design problem
2. Discussion of the problem
3. Illustration of the problem
4. The proposed solution

There are two additional pieces that make this book particularly relevant to
design systems in the fashion I’ve prescribed to them in writing thus far:

-   Each pattern’s documentation is preceded with a list of other patterns that
    employ the upcoming pattern
-   Each pattern’s documentation is followed by a list of other patterns that
    are required for this pattern

What this leads to is a choose-your-own adventure book that allows you to select
a particular pattern and get all the information you need about what work must
be done to put the pattern to use, as well as what other features you unlock by
employing the pattern.

For the purposes of demonstration, we can consider a similar approach for
documenting UI components:

> ### Form
>
> _Composes: Login Page, Entity Creation Page, Search Form_
>
> At a minimum, a form is composed of a label, input, and button. They are
> required to capture user input. {Further problem definition and discussion…}
>
> _Composed of: Button, Input, Label_

We can imagine coming to the definition of this Form pattern after deciding we
need to have some way for the user to create some kind of data entity. If so
inclined, we can dig further to find the definition of the Button pattern:

> ### Button
>
> _Composes: Form, Banner, Navigation_
>
> A Button is a low-level component that represents a familiar user concept.
> {Further problem definition and discussion…}
>
> _Composed of: Background, Border, Text, Spacing, Cursor_

_Aha!_ From our definition of the Button pattern, we start to see the primitive,
atomic components surface. With further investigation, we might find the very
bottom of our system hierarchy, with an illustrative example of all permutations
of text size, background color, or spacing units.

One final detail I find particularly pleasing about _A Pattern Language_ is the
notable addition of asterisks (<mark>\*</mark>) in some pattern titles. Two
asterisks after the pattern title (<mark>\*\*</mark>) indicates almost complete
certainty in the pattern’s validity to solve the given problem. One asterisk
(<mark>\*</mark>) indicates that the pattern is appropriate for most instances
of the stated problem. Finally, the absence of an asterisk indicates to the
reader that the problem is more difficult to solve with a single solution, and
that the presented solution is open for interpretation or change.

## What Bends Doesn't Break

One of the most appealing things about defining a pattern language or design
system in this way is the flexibility that it affords. For novice builders who
just need a high-level component or concept of their project, they can find it
at the top of the heirarchy and use the component as it comes. For those
pioneering new experiences or experimenting beyond the confines of existing
produce surface, they can take those high-level components and concepts and
deconstruct them into their composite parts; they can keep doing this until they
have the primitive, atomic components they need to construct a bespoke pattern
that still fits with harmony in the wider system.

What's more, this approach is aligned with our expectation that product teams
have
[deep knowledge of a particular problem set](/2017/06/27/paving-the-path-of-least-resistance/),
and the system simply generalises that which is generalisable. In fact, as an
exercise, you could write pattern definitions for existing design systems—like
those of [Salesforce](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/),
[BuzzFeed](http://solid.buzzfeed.com/), [GitHub](http://primercss.io/), and
[Google](https://material.io/)—and likely find that 99% of the patterns are
shared. Nuances of visual appearance (and some very specific use cases) set
aside, design systems are almost identical across platforms, products, and
locales, and all but the atomic components can be accounted for without
knowledge of this context.

This approach to building a grammar for our design vocabulary seems sound, and
certainly makes a strong case for writing easy-to-understand documentation, but
a question that remains for myself and for others building design systems is
_how this works in practice_. How do these definitions of patterns manifest in
design tools and engineering workflows? What are the technical limits and debts
associated with composing and deconstructing patterns in this way? Certainly
composition, even across platforms, is viable, as can be seen through AirBnB's
efforts to
[bridge design and engineering](https://airbnb.design/painting-with-code/)
through concepts of UI primitives. But decomposition and re-assembly of patterns
seems unrealistic, especially at the scale and complexity of platforms like
Facebook or Google.

All I can say with confidence is that with the legacy of fields like
architecture and traditional graphic design, the infancy of digital design
systems presents us with a rich variety of avenues for experimentation—and
that's a very exciting invitation indeed.
