We've come a long way in this theoretical exploration of an atomic design
system. The first step was discarding preconceived notions of a design library
as a catalogue of ready-made components, and embracing instead the discrete
properties that make up the components as the toolkit from which UI systems are
built. But giving designers and engineers an atomic toolkit and leaving them to
it is akin to asking them to create the universe when they just want to create a
log in screen.

In the [last post](/2017/07/12/a-design-system-grammar/) I wrote about design
systems, I compared a possible approach for building atomic design systems to
the book _A Pattern Language_, solidifying a framework for documenting
compositions of “atoms” into components and patterns. This style of documenting
the ready-made components reveals the atomic structure without burdening product
teams with the challenge of figuring out their combinations. I concluded the
post with a challenge, positing that most design systems already in existence
share the vast majority of their patterns and components with one another,
regardless of platform, audience, or context. I'd like to further clarify this
notion and complete the picture of our theoretical system by introducing some
structural domains.

You can think of our system so far as a tree, with its most primitive elements
at the bottom, comprising our atomic elements. These atoms—colors, spacing
units, typography, and even dimensions of time, as in animations and
transitions—are composed into components, and further composed to create
patterns, which are common solutions to common problems.

But what lives beyond patterns? What properties dictate the patterns that we
choose to lean on? There's obvious overlap between, say, a button on one product
and a button on another product, but how does one whittle down the multitude of
available patterns across all contexts to only those relevant to the immediate
context?

I'd like to introduce a top-level element of the tree of our design system; the
concept. Think of the concept as the definition of the environment, audience,
platform, and purpose of a system, with the ultimate goal of narrowing the
relevant patterns and components available to only the sensible ones. For
instance, in a 2D screen-based context like the web, we have few opportunities
to use spatial cues, so we needn't hold on to elements of the system—patterns
and components—that are more suitable for VR, AR, or other three-dimensional
environments.

With the notion of a concept at the top of our tree, and that of atomic
properties at the very bottom, we can see three rough divisions of the system.

The conceptual domain is the home of overarching principles. This domain
describes the environment, audience, and overall purpose of a product, and it
changes based on those variables. I also think of this as the “essence,” or in
linguistic terms, the story.

The pattern domain is the fixed, middle piece. It describes the patterns and
components that are utilized in order to make the story a reality. This can be
thought of as the “execution,” or in linguistic terms, words and sentences.
These elements stay roughly the same no matter what the concept is, but their
frequency of use and degree of usefulness varies with different concepts. In
other words, both a horror story and a nonfiction reference book may use the
same language and terms, but to a different end.

The final domain is the visual domain, and like the conceptual domain, it
changes between products, contexts, and platforms. It describes the primitive
pieces that comprise the patterns and components—colors, text, and other
“atomic” properties that make a brand or product distinct. This can be thought
of as the “expression,” or in linguistic terms, the alphabet.

A system designed in this domain hierarchy may best be documented in plain
writing, describing the Concept, Patterns, and Components in conceptual terms,
agnostic of their surroundings. Using these descriptions of the system, the
designer and engineer may draw their own conclusions about the comprising parts
and their best implementation. This works well for the particular motivations of
both roles: the designer is tasked with visually representing ideas and
information using their available tools; the engineer is tasked with
representing ideas and information through logical, mathematical, and modular
transformations of data, using their available tools. In an ideal world, the
solutions of the designer and the engineer converge and are ultimately the same,
but today's tools make this ideal difficult (though not impossible) to achieve.

This framework can be applied with ease to many design systems (digital or not)
in existence, but new mediums present a challenge; what if the Concept we start
with dictates we forget 100% of the patterns and components we are already
familiar with? Take mediums such as Virtual Reality or voice-centric interfaces
as examples. While in VR, paradigms like buttons may still be somewhat
applicable, most other UI conventions are useless in contexts where spatial,
auditory, or temporal cues constitute the majority of our available tools. In
these cases, an expansion of the role of the Conceptual domain is in order,
allowing more experimental exploration, and combined with an acceptance of
ambiguity in the visual domain, one might successfully fill out and innovate in
the pattern domain.

We may, in fact, learn more about our biases as designers through the lens of a
new medium. What conventions do we too readily conjur as solutions to problems
on mobile devices, in spite of the differences in environment and context? Only
very recently have we seen products that use a more expressive and inventive
range of technologies available in any smartphone, such as the camera or the
device's location, even though these capabilities have been available for years.
More routinely forgetting convention might open new opportunities that are
ordinarily hard to see.
