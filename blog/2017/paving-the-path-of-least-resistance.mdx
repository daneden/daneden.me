Design systems can sometimes feel like a shackle on the product development
process. Where they are rigid, as is often required of design systems in order
for them to succeed, they may slow down product teams when their coverage
doesn’t extend to the requirements of the task at hand. When the system is too
loose or ambiguous, it does a poor job of guiding the process in a way that
prevents redundant or inconsistent work.

There are models of working with design systems—and the teams that maintain
them—that can help subside the slowing of progress they sometimes impose, and
instead create a virtuous cycle of feedback that helps the design system grow in
a self-sufficient way.

Rather than design systems acting as a guideline or a police-like force, the
teams working on product development should allow its constituents—experts at
their jobs—to do their best work, unhindered by the limits of the system. The
job of the design systems team becomes largely an observational role; we observe
the limits of the system, detect the abstracts of the problem the product team
is trying to solve, and apply those abstracts to a solution that can be
generalized to broader uses.

More concretely, product teams have a narrow yet extremely _deep_ understanding
of a particular problem set. They may, for instance, stretch a particular
component in a system so thin that they need to build their own set of
extensions to the component. Rather than preventing this kind of apparent misuse
of the system, the design systems team should encourage it, since it reveals
blind spots that are easy to miss when developing a general solution. They take
what they can from the extensions and hacks necessary for that specific product
team, and generalize them for use amongst other teams and in chorus with other
components.

The resulting system should embody a well-defined set of broad rules; patterns
that solve 80–90% of the problems faced by product development teams, that serve
to prevent needless cycles of thought and work, and ensure greater consistency.
The remaining 10–20% not well-covered by the system is where the product team
exercises their expertise and imbues the product with a uniqueness that is
expressive, but well within the expected style of the system.

When teams maintaining design systems are working closely with product teams in
an embedded and observational way, this kind of output is inevitable. As I think
more about the dynamic between design systems teams and product teams, it
becomes apparent that systems rely on the product teams just as heavily, if not
more, than vice versa. Without product teams to poke and prod at the system,
stretch it, and break it, design systems would be built in a vacuum and their
creators would be left with undeserved pride.

You can think of design systems much like paving roads. The busiest roads with
the most commonly-trafficked routes are deservedly well-maintained, but they
aren't the only roads available. No matter the destination, it is the duty of
those responsible for paving those roads to enable the travelers to arrive with
haste and safety. It is a job that requires constant maintenance, and when done
well, shouldn't be noticed by its customers at all.
