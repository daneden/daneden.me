  Daniel Eden is writing, thinking, and talking about Design Systems: how they
  break, how they scale, and the people that maintain them.

I'm currently living in Oakland, California and working as a Designer for
[Facebook](https://facebook.com). I help to create and maintain the Facebook
Design System: a set of components, patterns, guidance, and tools to help
hundreds of product teams build experiences for billions of people. Previously,
I worked as a Designer and Engineer for [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com).

I spend my time [Tweeting](http://twitter.com/_dte "@_dte on Twitter"), taking
[photographs](https://photos.daneden.me/ "Daniel's Photography"), making
[art](https://art.daneden.me/ "Daniel's generative art"), and [writing
code](https://github.com/daneden "daneden on GitHub"). I also [write](/blog "Daniel's blog posts") about design, courage, and lack thereof.

I'm currently unavailable for work, but you can take a look at [my
résumé](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq431p4ey1b1ayu/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf "Daniel Eden’s résumé") anyway.
