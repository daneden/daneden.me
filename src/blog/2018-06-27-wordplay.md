# Wordplay: Language Structure in Design Systems

“A cat is black.”

Native English speakers will read that sentence and infer an alternative meaning
for it. We recognise that this particular arrangement of those particular words
is unusual: the writer probably meant to say “the cat is black.” We know that
when we say or write “_a_ cat is,” there’s a strong chance we will finish the
sentence by referring to the universal properties of the animal “cat,” and
when we say “_the_ cat is,” we’re probably going to talk about characteristics
of an individual cat.

Our brains react at astounding speed to resolve the unusual sentence “a cat is
black” and make mental corrections to store and refer back to later. The English
language in particular is highly context-dependent, such that the word “read”
may be pronounced differently only once we establish the tense (past, present,
or future) in which the word is used. These sorts of contextual judgements
happen on almost all words in a sentence, and they happen at staggering speeds
and with varying accuracy.

These sorts of nuances make the English language particularly difficult to learn
for non-native speakers, and leads to misunderstandings even amongst those
well-versed in the language. As a language, the structure and grammar of
English is flexible to a fault. We might be able to make some generalisations
about certain words: “has,” for example, might be crudely defined as being
possessive, such as “the cat has ears.” But the same word can also be used in
non-possessive ways, like “the cat has jumped,” where we can no longer say the
cat possesses a jump. This looseness makes it hard to make accurate
predictions or rules about how a sentence is structured. However, this liberal
flexibility may have some practical applications for design systems.

Given a word or small set of words, we can make predictions about what words and
structures might follow. Naively, this is how the predictive text on our mobile
devices works: look at the previous word, and make a prediction of what might
follow. Sophisticated prediction—like that of human beings—look at entire
sentences, or even passages[^1] of text to provide the right context and derive
the correct meaning for a word. How might we apply similar predictive structure
to design systems?

---

The design system could have some kind of learning function that is trained on
existing UI and component compositions, creating a [Markov
chain](http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/) of components and the likelihood that
component A will be followed by a different kind of component.

We could imagine making use of this data in the design process. When using a
component, we can take what we know about how that component is typically
configured and what other components typically follow it, and offer suggestions
in the design or engineering tool to help ‘complete’ the composition, or at
least encourage alignment with the most common uses. If, for example, I add a
text input to my design, our prediction model tells us that text inputs are
typically accompanied by a button, a label, or even another input.

<Image src="2018/06/wp-design.svg" caption="Naive prediction may have practical applications in design, where flexibility and context-dependency are actually sensible characteristics of a system." />

We could even go so far as to suggest all of these possibilities at once,
showing a designer multitudes of possible next steps and allowing them to use
their best judgement to decide, based on the product requirements, what makes
the most sense.[^2]

In addition to making suggestions to usher a design to completion, this tool
could warn us when we do something unusual. Just as native English speakers
recognise that the sentence “a cat is black” is strange, our system would know
that, for example, an arrangement of a dozen checkboxes and no labels is
unusual. This sort of feedback about unusual arrangements of components could be
especially helpful for teams that don’t have dedicated design resources.

Of course, in language, words or arrangements of words are only unusual during
their first appearances. Over time and with increased use, new phrases come into
being, and the meanings of words can change dramatically. Language evolves, and
UI patterns do too: the idea here is not to impose static, hard-and-fast rules
on how components should be built or arranged, but to provide suggestions based
on common uses, and to adapt to emerging uses as they arise.

---

The next obvious conclusion I can draw about this idea is that, like how in
the English language, a single word or short phrase at the end of a chain of
words can change the meaning of the preceding words entirely, so the same is
true of components: until the composition is complete, we may have a hard time
determining exactly how the initial components should be arranged.

This conclusion starts to peel away at one of the difficult things about
[Subatomic Design Systems](/2018/01/05/subatomic-design-systems/): a property
called [_emergence_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence), where within
systems composed of small parts, properties emerge that don't exist on the
individual parts. The whole becomes greater—or at least different—than the sum
of its parts. The _interactions between_ small pieces of composed systems
have properties of their own. This is something I'm still trying to wrap my head
around, but am excited to dive into.

  The two-sentence phrase “I had a haircut this weekend. It’s really \_\_\_\_”
  has some obvious conclusions for human beings: “short,” “different,” “bad,”
  “good,” but for machines, naive prediction may only look at the word “really”
  and try to predict how the sentence may end, resulting in suggestions like
  “long” or “excited.” Additionally, because many predictive text engines only
  look at the immediately preceding word, you can end up with never-ending and
  nonsensical sentences just by repeatedly tapping the suggestions on your phone.
  Try it: open up an app that allows you to type, enter “I am” and then keep
  pressing the suggestions that appear in your keyboard.
