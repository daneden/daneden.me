## Interesting Things

### `atoms.ts`

[`atoms.ts`](https://github.com/daneden/daneden.me/blob/main/src/components/designSystem/atoms.ts)
defines the atomic style values for the site's design system. This approach to
defining design system styles is documented in my blog post,
[Subatomic Design Systems](https://daneden.me/blog/2018/subatomic-design-systems).

Many of the atoms are mirrored in CSS variables declared in
[`Layout.tsx`](https://github.com/daneden/daneden.me/blob/main/src/components/Layout.tsx),
but occasionally (such as in the
[open graph image generator](#open-graph-image-generation)) need direct
reference in JavaScript.

### Open Graph Image Generation

I wanted to be able to generate images for blog posts based on their titles. To
achieve this, I have a
[function](https://github.com/daneden/daneden.me/blob/main/src/utils/ogImage.ts)
that runs at build time to generate OG images using `node-canvas`.

### `mdxUtils.ts`

[`mdxUtils.ts`](https://github.com/daneden/daneden.me/blob/main/src/utils/mdxUtils.ts)
has some handy functions to co-locate things I want to do with my blog posts,
including:

-   Getting all the blog posts and their front matter/metadata
-   Sorting by date and filtering out "hidden" posts
-   Keeping track of post categories
-   Getting posts by category

### `widont.ts`

A personal favourite,
[`widont.ts`](https://github.com/daneden/daneden.me/blob/main/src/utils/widont.ts)
is a tiny function that replaces the last space in a string with a non-breaking
space. Great for preventing widows on post titles.
