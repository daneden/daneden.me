# Hello, Good Evening, and Welcome

Welcome to the innards of [my website](http://daneden.me). It’s built using
Gatsby and deployed on ZEIT Now.

## Installation

- Make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed
- `git clone https://github.com/daneden/daneden.me`
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn develop`
- Party.

To build for production, run `yarn build`.

## Who This Repo is For

This repo is mostly for me. I, like many of you, host my code on GitHub for
reasons of portability, ease of work, and peace of mind. Beyond my own needs, I
have also open-sourced this repo for you, the reader (and most likely
developer), to explore the things that make my site tick.
