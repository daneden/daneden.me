It's a new year, and an exciting one at that. I'll (finally) be graduating this Spring and looking for a job I love in a place I love. There are a few things I've promised to do this year, as well. I want to take more photos. I want to make more things. And I want to learn something new. I want to see change. And I thought I'd initiate some of that change on this website.

With any luck, you'll be surprised at a few of the changes I've made to the site. The current design has been sitting for long enough for me to have gauged the things I like and don't like about it, so I've given it a slight "realign." Let's dig in.



## Made For Reading


One thing I've always found interesting about most websites is that they're not actually that well suited for reading. Line lengths on many websites are either far too short or far too long; white space is sparsely used; typography is dismissed with little thought, and all this is getting worse with responsive design. I set myself one clear goal with the realignment of my site. I want to read it comfortably on my iPad.

The more I use the iPad, the more I feel like it was made for reading. At the very least, the iPad's portrait orientation was designed for reading. iBooks looks great, and more recently, Marco Arment's [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org) reads great. Switching to my own site after reading The Magazine was a jarring experience. I took a lesson from The Magazine's larger margins and brought them to my own site. The result is a neatly thumb-sized margin placed either side of the text on tablets in portrait orientation, perfect for scrolling without getting in the way of the content.

I made everything a little lighter. The top bar and navigation has been inverted. Everything is crisp and white, save for the footer which has been made a little lighter. The typography has had an update, too. Skolar and Proxima Nova make a great pairing with a lot of personality, but readability suffered a little. A few times, I found myself annoyed by the subtle slab serifs on Skolar. In their place is Freight Text Pro and Freight Sans Pro, as inspired by my latest small project, [Type Twins](http://daneden.me/type/twins). Everything is a lot more reader friendly (on Mac & iOS, at least. Apologies for the poor rendering, Windows users. Blame Typekit.)

As a result of the slightly smaller fonts, the column has been made a little narrower, giving yet more breathing room to the text. Everything else remains more or less the same. I did it all pretty quickly, because a lot of the changes I'd already had in my mind before I sat down to make them. As usual, it's all a work in progress. Happy reading.
